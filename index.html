  <h4><strong>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</strong></h4>
  <p>
    The <strong>Šarplaninac</strong> or <strong>Sharr dog</strong> is a breed of
    dog of livestock guardian type. It is named for the Šar Mountains or Šar
    Planina range in the Balkans, where it is principally found.
    <br />
    It was recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as the
    Illyrian Shepherd Dog or Ilirski Ovčar from 1939 until 1957,
    <br />
    when the name was changed to
    <strong
      >Yugoslavian Shepherd Dog - Sharplanina or Jugoslovenski Ovčarski Pas -
      Šarplaninac.</strong
    >
    <br />
    <br />

    In Ottoman times, the dogs moved with the flocks of sheep, spending the
    summer in the area of the Šar Mountains and the winter in Thessaly, where
    they were known as <strong>Greek Shepherd Dogs</strong>.

  <h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
  <!-- horizontal line -->
  <hr />
  <p>
    The origins of the Šarplaninac are not known. It was traditionally used to
    guard cattle or sheep.<br />

    In the transhumant system of management, livestock was moved twice a year,
    to the high mountain pastures for the summer, and to the warmer plains for
    the winter. <br />

    In the southern Balkans, very large numbers of sheep were moved in this way,
    accompanied by men and dogs.
    <br />
    <br />

    The Šarplaninac is found mainly in the Šar Mountains, where it is thought to
    have originated and from which the name 'Šarplaninac' derives.<br />
    It is also distributed in the areas of the Jablanica, Korab and Pelister
    mountains.

  <h2><strong>Characteristics</strong></h2>
  <!-- horizontal line -->
  <hr />
  <p>
    The Šarplaninac is a large and strongly built dog. The body is slightly
    longer than the height at the withers, and the front legs account for
    approximately 55% of the height. <br>
    The head is large but proportional to the
    body, with dark eyes. <br>It is a robust, well-proportioned dog with plenty of
    bone, of a size that is well above the average and with a thick, long,
    rather coarse coat that emphasises the short-coupled appearance.<br>

     Dogs weigh some 35-45 kg, bitches about 5 kg less. The average
    height at the withers is 62 cm for dogs and 58 cm for bitches.<br>
    It is
    always solid in colour: fawn, iron grey, white or almost black; usually
    sable or grey with darker "overalls" on the head and back, the undercoat
    being paler. <br>
    The colour need not be completely uniform, and most Šarplaninac
    have several different shades of the same colour fading into one another.
    The dogs may be expected to live for some 11-13 years.
