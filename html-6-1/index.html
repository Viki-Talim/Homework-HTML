          <h1>Big Lake, Pelister</h1>
          <p>
            The first encounter with this lake at an altitude of 2,218 meters
            arouses admiration and stunning mystique that does not leave you
            indifferent. The first impression leaves a lasting memory of the
            strange energy that springs from the lake depths. And Big Lake, with
            its 14.5-meter depth, 226 meters long and 175 meters wide, looks
            impressive when viewed from the Peak above the lake.

            Mavrovo village is perched on the slopes of the Bistra Mountains
            overlooking Mavrovo Lake, an artificial body of water that was
            created in 1947 by damming the Mavrovo River. Once water filled the
            basin, some buildings were submerged. Only one of these buildings is
            still standing: St Nicholas Church.
