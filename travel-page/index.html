      <p>
        Rome was called the “Eternal City” by the ancient Romans because they
        believed <br />that no matter what happened in the rest of the world,
        the city of Rome would <br />always remain standing. Exploring the city
        centre by foot surrounded by glorious <br />monuments and colossal
        remains takes you back in time to the glory that was<br />
        Rome.

          The Pantheon boasts the largest unsupported <br />concrete dome in the
          world. Incredible, but true - <br />in the nearly 2,000 years since
          the Pantheon was completed, no unreinforced concrete dome
          <br />anywhere in the world has ever been <br />built on such a
          scale.</em

          The Colosseum was once a site for gladiatorial duels, where gladiators
          and wild animals battled each other for the entertainment of the
          locals. Ancient Romans even received free entry to the events held
          here, and it was the equivalent to watching a major sporting event
          today.</em

          The Trevi Fountain, built in the 1700s, is perhaps one of Rome's most
          iconic structures. Erected on the site of an ancient Roman water
          source, the fountain is made of the same material as the Colosseum
          (travertine stone). The Trevi Fountain serves as a modern marvel that
          links back to Rome's fabled past.
