      <h1 class="header-1">Rome - the Eternal City</h1>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Rome was called the “Eternal City” by the ancient Romans because they
          believed <br />that no matter what happened in the rest of the world,
          the city of Rome would <br />always remain standing. Exploring the
          city centre by foot surrounded by glorious <br />monuments and
          colossal remains takes you back in time to the glory that was<br />
          Rome.

      <h1 class="header-2">Why Visit Rome?</h1>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          With its unparalleled history, Rome is the 3rd most visited city in
          Europe and the 14th worldwide. It attracts visitors from all over the
          world who come to discover the city's impressive monuments and
          archaeological sites; not to mention its renowned cuisine and its
          lively atmosphere. Walking through Rome is not just about touring an
          ancient city full of archaeological remains; Rome reminds us of
          gladiators fighting for life and death in the Colosseum, chariots
          racing in the Circus Maximus, and the sight of Roman sages strolling
          through the forum while discussing democracy. With more than 16
          million visitors a year, tourism in Rome is unstoppable. It's the 3rd
          most visited city in Europe, behind London and Paris, making it a high
          contender for the most romantic city in Europe.

          The Pantheon boasts the largest unsupported concrete dome in the
          world. Incredible, but true - in the nearly 2,000 years since the
          Pantheon was completed, no unreinforced concrete dome anywhere in the
          world has ever been built on such a scale.

          The Colosseum was once a site for gladiatorial duels, where gladiators
          and wild animals battled each other for the entertainment of the
          locals. Ancient Romans even received free entry to the events held
          here, and it was the equivalent to watching a major sporting event
          today.

          The Trevi Fountain, built in the 1700s, is perhaps one of Rome's most
          iconic structures. Erected on the site of an ancient Roman water
          source, the fountain is made of the same material as the Colosseum
          (travertine stone). The Trevi Fountain serves as a modern marvel that
          links back to Rome's fabled past.
